    "<p>For me, the simplest definition of mindfulness is knowing where your attention is directed in the present moment.  This is a bit different from being “caught up in the moment” when we are sort of lost in the moment, in our thinking or whatever we are doing.  The main difference I think is the knowledge of where your attention is directed at present.  

    Developing mindfulness then is a matter of choosing something to pay attention to and deliberately directing your attention to it. This could be the sensations in your body, your breathing,  your immediate surroundings, your thoughts and feelings or sounds.  If you know where your mind is at, then you are being mindful, if not it is simply a matter of redirecting your attention to whatever you have chosen to be aware of.</p>

    <h3>Why practice mindfulness?</h3>
    <p>
      People practice mindfulness for all sorts of reasons including relaxation, spiritual development and ‘self improvement’.  It is often utilized to help treat and manage various mental health conditions including stress, anxiety and depression.  My advice to those looking for help with serious mental illnesses is to practice mindfulness under the guidance of a qualified mental health practitioner, preferably one with mindfulness experience.   Mindfulness is a useful tool in treating mental health conditions, but it is not a panacea. 
  
      I personally like to practice mindfulness both for its numerous mental health benefits and simply for the pleasure of having a clear and quiet mind.  I have experienced over the years a greater level of control (not mastery) over my thoughts and emotions as a result of developing the skill of mindfulness.
    </p>
    <h3>A skill and a habit</h3>
    <p>
      Whatever draws you to the practice of mindfulness it is important to understand that it is a skill that is developed over time, not an experience to be gained instantly and easily.  The benefits of mindfulness are only gained after consistent and regular practice.  It’s a bit like learning a musical instrument.  Most people can’t even make a tune when they first pick up a new instrument, however after a few months or years of practice they gain the joy of creating music.
  
      While it's important to be consistent in practicing mindfulness, it’s best not to become obsessed with it.  You don’t need to be mindful twenty-four hours a day to benefit from it.
    </p>
    <h3>Getting started</h3>
    <p>One of the best ways to introduce yourself to mindfulness is with guided meditations.  These are pre recorded talks where someone talks you through a formal mindfulness meditation.  The website and app at <a href='https://www.smilingmind.com.au/' target='_blank'>Smiling Mind</a> have lots of guided meditations to get you started.</p>"

  "<p>Find a suitable place to sit for twenty minutes or so, somewhere you’re not likely to be distracted by other people or technology.  Switch your phone to do not disturb and set a timer for however long you’d like to meditate for.  Twenty minutes is a good amount of time for beginners.  Forty five minutes or longer for more experienced meditators.  

  Sit on a chair or on the edge of a bed with both feet on the ground.  Keep your back straight and head upright.  Feel what it's like to just sit there with your eyes open for a few moments then gently close or half close your eyes.

  Now bring your attention to what’s happening in the present moment in and around you: sounds you can hear, feelings in your body, sensations of warmth or coolness.  Feel the pressure of your body on the seat, notice how much of your legs are touching the seat, and the remainder which is more exposed to the space around you.  Feel the weight of your feet connected to the floor and sense the distance or lack thereof between your feet. Notice the sensations in your back and adjust your posture if necessary.  Feel your body as a whole, experiencing the sensation of sitting.

  At this time you may start to notice your attention being distracted by thoughts.  This is perfectly normal for all but the most seasoned meditation practitioners.  When you notice you’ve been distracted simply acknowledge this and return your attention to the sensations in your body.  Use your bodily awareness as a reference point to return your mind to the present moment and sustain it there.

  After grounding your attention in mindfulness of your bodily sensations, gently bring your attention to the sensations of breathing.  Are you breathing in or out?  Feel the breath in a broad way, notice your torso expanding and contacting, the sensation of air entering and leaving your nostrils, the feeling of the breath moving through your throat and sinus. You can even pay attention to the way your shoulders lift and then drop on the in and out breath.  

  Again if you notice you’ve been distracted by thinking, simply acknowledge this and bring your attention  back to this broad awareness of the breathing process.  Resist the urge to discourage yourself if you find yourself distracted.  Instead encourage your mind for returning to mindfulness.  “Oh good I noticed I was lost, now I’m meditating again, well done.”  Something along those lines.

  After watching the breath like this for a while, try to watch a full breath from the start of the in-breath to the end of the out-breath.  If you notice you get distracted simply acknowledge this and try again.  Keep trying to watch each breath from start to finish, allowing yourself the freedom to ‘fall off’ and start again as many times as necessary, even if it happens on every breath.  

  Keep practising like this until your timer finishes. Gently bring the session to a close by expanding your awareness to your general bodily sensations and the sounds around you.  If you like, take some time to repeat some positive affirmations, then fully open your eyes.

  Take a few moments to stretch your body and get your body moving again before going about your business.</p>"

    '<p>Find a flat, straight path about twenty steps end to end.  Preferably somewhere you’re not likely to be disturbed.  You can practise walking meditation barefooted or with your shoes on.  If you intend on having a long session it is better to wear shoes to prevent hurting or injuring your feet. Switch your phone to do not disturb and set a timer for the desired length of time.  

    Stand at one end of the path with your chin up and gaze set at about five metres in front of you.  Let your hands hang naturally by your sides.  Start walking at an easy pace towards the other side, bringing your awareness to the sensations of walking, simply feeling what it’s like to walk, how it feels in your body and mind. When you reach the other side simply stop, turn around and begin walking again, being aware of your movements as you do so.

    Become aware of your legs and feet as they move, your arms swinging, the slight rock in your hips. Become aware of the way your clothing feels on your body as it moves and the subtle sensation of air moving against any bare skin. These sensations are your reference point for present moment awareness. If you get distracted by thinking, acknowledge this and then renew your awareness of the walking sensations.
    Continue practising like this until your timer goes off.</p>
    <h3>Variations</h3>
    <p>
      Slow your walking down slightly and direct most of your attention to your feet.  Be aware of each step you take, focusing on the feeling of your feet moving through the air.  Try to maintain a clear awareness of which foot is stepping.  You can note each step in your mind, thinking: right foot, left foot, etc.  However the majority of your attention should be focussed on the  awareness of the experience, rather than the mental description.  This can be a good way to learn to distinguish between thinking and awareness.
      When you reach the end of the path turn around, being aware of the movements of your feet as you do so.  Pause for a moment to re-establish mindfulness before resuming your walk to the other side.  
      Keep practising in this way until the end of your session.

    Need some fresh air? Our resident psychologist Catherine Morey-Nase explains how an occasional hike in the great outdoors won’t only benefit your physical body, but also has significant benefits on our mental health.

  Hiking in nature provides an opportunity to tune in — both to our own experience and to the world around us. While it can be easy to get lost in thought or daydreams while hiking, the simple practice of mindfulness can draw us more closely into our experience of the natural world.

  Hiking outdoors can also deepen our connection with friends and family.

    Hiking while enjoying great conversation and laughter is one of life’s most enjoyable activities, it’s about remembering to stop and smell the roses, or the eucalyptus, as the case may be.

  Unlike a traditional gym, the added benefit is that you are getting some fresh air. Hiking exercises both your body and your mind, and the benefits are endless, including:

    stress and anxiety reduction
    increased energy, emotional regulation
    enhanced awareness and creativity
    improved concentration
    increased productivity


While walking, you strengthen and oxygenate all of the major muscle groups including your brain, and rejuvenating your senses while captivating your heart.

    Nature truly has a healing and restorative power, being outdoors also helps alleviate stress and anxiety, and assists with recovery from mental fatigue.

While seated meditation practice is important, hiking is also a great opportunity to be more mindful in an informal way.
Our top tips for mindful hiking

Mindfulness is a simple practice which can reduce stress and increase calmness. Learning how to be mindful while hiking is straightforward, and the benefits can come quickly.

    Pay attention to each step;
    Bring awareness to your senses;
        Stop and look at what is above and below you
        Pause and listen to the soothing sounds of the outdoors
        Touch and feel the contact of air against your skin
        Smell the scents around you</p>
