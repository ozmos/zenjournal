<p>Here you will find information on mindfulness and meditation from my own perspective, and that of other experienced meditators.  This is not intended to be an exhaustive instructive manual, but rather a collection of short instructions and personal reflections. Take what you find useful or appealing from the articles here and put it to use in your own practice of meditation.</p>
